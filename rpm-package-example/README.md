# RPM Package example

Structure of RPM package is defined in the openright rpm deploy package.  

It uses the Maven Tiles Plugin to mixin the structure of the RPM and RPM resources with the server artifact (here taken from the jaxws-jersey example)

It is possible to override the various RPM options through properties.
See example for some, the rpm deploy package for more.
